Checklists:

- added date field so as to split data and get better visualizations
- date values were in inconsistent format so we unified one format




Notes:

- The MSE value being close to zero suggests that the model is making accurate predictions for the 'Jump' modality.
- A low MSE indicates that the model is performing well, as it means the predicted values are very close to the actual values.
- The closer the MSE is to zero, the better the model's performance.

In summary, a low MSE suggests that the RandomForestRegressor model is effectively capturing the relationship between the features and the 'Jump' modality, resulting in accurate predictions. This is a positive outcome for your predictive modeling task.
